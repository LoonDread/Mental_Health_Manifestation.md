## What I find Helpful about Intentional Peer support and its core values 

Most of the peer support I recieve is based around [Intentional peer support](https://intentionalpeersupport.org/) and is what I have been trained in. I find this aproach helpful because it allows for conflicting ***worldviews/Perspectives***  to be respectfully expressed. This is important to me beacause it allow me to hear views that is different from mine and allow me to reassess or change my worldveiw if neccessary. One the thing that Intentional peer support made me reflect on is the diagnosis/psychatric approach that I learned form Studying psychology which was trigger by discusing alternative to it like Holistic/community. In this reflection I realised there more than one way to healing and diverse approach to mental health healing is needed. 

I find it helpful how ***Mutality*** support the exploration of ***worldviews*** by allowing empathic connect to the common emotion and realities of people I engage with. To empathically connet with someone makes I feel less alone and include into a commmunity. It reduces the feeling of beeing othered and safe enough to explore others ***Worldviews*** as well express mine. It gives space for geninue ***connection*** to develop which goes beyond difference in ***worldviews***. It allows for a diverse community eco-system to develope. 

Being able to develope  geninue ***Connection*** is truely benefical to my mental health and wellbeing because having ***Connection*** based in ***mutuality*** allows for me to feel respected and get better understanding everyone. It allows for people to connect in more meaningful ways. The ***connection*** I get from peersupport is reassuring, surportive, and  is ***moving towards*** embetterment through building ***Connection*** with a more various spectrum of ***worldview*** which at time challenges my **worldview** in a support, caring, respectful and supportive manner. The ***connection*** I have through my INternational peersupport relationships can be challenging but give great oppurtinity for growth and ***moving towards*** a better me. 

***Moving towards*** is greatly important to my mental health. I creates a growth mind set. Allowing progress to happen over time, even when there set backs. This prevent me from feeling stagnant. It continously froster hope, persistancy, and determination. Yet ***connection*** reminds me that I do not have do it alone and that helpful support as well as advice can from others. Internentional peer support also encourages me to listen to other people ***worldviews*** in way the encouraging me to ***moving towards*** better mental health and welling by encouraging me listen respecful to Other peoples ***worldveiws*** to give me new prespectives to consider. The respect come from the ***mutality*** of the ***connection*** enagement. 

**CORE PRINCIPLES OF INTENTIONAL PEER:** ***worldviews, connection, mutality, and moving towards***

## What I finding helpful supportive friends and important qualities

I find that if a supportive friend ***seeing me for me*** it can a more guiune connection that allow for my authentic self be expressed. This put less stress on my mind and body when engaging with supportive friends. Enable me be freer to discuss more challenge topics to ***expand my thinking*** leading changes wellbeing behaviours and my worldview, which ***encourages my growth***. Yet a supportive relationships has mutuality built into it, Where ***we value each other***. Enable us to support each other growth and development by lifting ourselve up together at the same time without the pushing one down. 

I greatly appreciate the effort my supportive friends and I put into lifting each other up and not leaving friends behind as each of us experience growth. My Supportive friends that ***encourages my growth*** are highly value to me. Them also value me and what I have offer adds to my self esteem. For us to ***value each other*** we need to have mutuality and encourage each others growth. For my supportive friends to be ***encouring of my growth*** they need to ***expand my thinking*** and get me to think in new ways. This ***encourages my growth*** by giving me knew perspective and idea to consider. For me intergrate in to my worldview and understanding. Allowing changes in my mental health and wellbeing. Due to the mutuality of the engagement with my supportive friends we all get an oppurtinity to ***expand our thinking*** and to experience growth. 

For a supportive friend to be able to ***expand my thinking*** they need to respectfully and confidently express thier worldview to me. They must expect that I would not always aggree with them or automatically take on board what they say. That I would atleast politely listen and I expect the same from them. Where we all allow time to proccess information and perspectives. To also seek out other prepectives and world views. For us not to be shaped by one connection but many connection. Enabling a well rounded human to develop. I find this Important because I like to see diverse range of worldview and compare it to mine. Helping to discover weakness in my worldview.  

I find that ***we valuing each other*** encourages the development of trust, collaboration, growing together, self-estem and wellbeing growth. Meaning there is something for each us to gain from relationship but not neccessary in transactional way. The value I feel each of has to give goes beyond that. We are value for the uniqueness we bring to each other. That what we have to offer is not measured but honoured and respect. This done by repecting each other Worldview but also honouring value of our own at the same time without ignoring the wisedom within the others worldview. To encourage each others growth and expansion of thinking. To help consider ourselves a teammates rather that adversaries. 

**Important qualities:** ***seeing me for me, expands my thinking, encourages my growth, and we value each other.***

Community peer support needs to be ***accepting*** of my Identities to ***encourage identity development***.

Different communities support different Identities and sometime multiply ones at the same time. ***Accepting*** my identities makes me feel like I do not need to hide behind a front and be honest about who I am without being discriminating against. Alllowing me to be freer in my expression and  more relaxed in socail suituations. Enabling me to safely and honest explore my identities to ***encourage identity development***. 

My communitties ***encouraging identity development*** is crucial to me better understanding myself and to process what the Identities I have mean to me. It helps me express and define myself better. To grow Into the skin of my identities and let it morph into the beauty of who I am truly. Removing the restrictive chains of expectation in discrimination. Enabling me to openly ***celebrate*** the realities of my identities and learn Who I truely. In ***accepting*** and understanding company which ***engages in activism*** when they feel our identities are getting unfairly attacked. Yet still leaving room for ***celebratory*** nature of the communities I enjoy. 

For my communities being actively ***engaged in activism*** is highly valued by me because it means that something is being done about the discrimination and hatred I experience. That someone is sticking up for my rights when I do not have the capicity to does so. Creating a chances for change. Leading to the pontential to create a better engagement with the wider community. Enable me to be less isolated and discriminated against. Improving myself esteem due to fact I am recieving less negative statement and voilence towards myself and others. As welling seeing people supporting my identities and making sure that my identities are welcome in the wider community. At times activism is celebrating my identities.
