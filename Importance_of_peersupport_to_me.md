## The model of peersupport I recieve. 

Most of the peer support I recieve is based around [Intentional peer support](https://intentionalpeersupport.org/) and what I have been trained in. I find this aproach helpful because it allows for conflicting worldviews/Perspectives to be respectfully expressed. This is important to me beacause it allow me to hear views that is different from mine and allow me to reassess or change my worldveiw if neccessary. One the thing that Intentional peer support made me reflect on is the diagnosis/psychatric approach that I learned form Studying psychology which was trigger by discusing alternative to it like Holistic/community. In thi reflection I realised there more than one way to healing and diverse approach to mental health healing is needed.
